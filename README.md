# dynamic-task-perception
A collection of code files for modeling the interaction between dynamic task-belief and perception using RNNs.

Written in the Cohen Lab in collaboration with Cheng Xue. This project uses the package PsychRNN: https://psychrnn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

The project involves analysis and extension of the results discussed in the paper "Dynamic task-belief is an integral part of decision-making" by Cheng Xue, Lily Kramer, and Marlene Cohen. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.05.010.
